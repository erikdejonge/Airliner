Sure man, in the credit, it would be great if you could link to iTunes
within the program and direct them to my music.

Thanks for asking and please let me know when the game is approved!

Dear Ronald,<br>
<br>
Would you be interested in lending us a few tracks for our first iPhone gam=
e. It&#39;s an educational fun game where you have to fly to the countries =
of the world (screenshot attached).<br>
We are looking for a relaxing music which can loop in the back.<br>
We liked &quot;beautifull sky&quot; from this website.<br>

But that&#39;s $150 per song, that&#39;s quite a lot.<br>
Off course you will be prominently in the credits.<br>
